Little Bean â€” Demo Coffee Shop Website

How to open

Open `index.html` in your browser. For a local server (recommended to enable smooth scroll and relative asset loading), run a simple static server in PowerShell:

# Using Python 3 (if installed)
python -m http.server 8000

# Or using Node.js http-server (install first)
npm install -g http-server; http-server -p 8000

Then visit http://localhost:8000 in your browser.

Notes

- Images in `assets/` are placeholders. Replace them with your high-res photography for client demos.
